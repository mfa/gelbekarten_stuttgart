The city of Stuttgart provides an issue reporting system called “Gelbe Karte” (yellow card) for citizens to report issues, ideas or questions.

Dataformat is the same as in [https://qri.cloud/mfdz/stuttgart_gelbekarten](https://qri.cloud/mfdz/stuttgart_gelbekarten),
however this code runs using Github Actions and is checked in this repo - inspired by @simonw's post on ["Git scraping"](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).
