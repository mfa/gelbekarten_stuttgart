## Scrape Stuttgarts "Gelbe Karten"

The city of Stuttgart provides an issue reporting system called “Gelbe Karte” (yellow card) for citizens to report issues, ideas or questions.

Dataformat is the same as in [https://qri.cloud/mfdz/stuttgart_gelbekarten](https://qri.cloud/mfdz/stuttgart_gelbekarten),
but the code is run using Github Actions and checked in this repo, inspired by @simonw's post on ["Git scraping"](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).
